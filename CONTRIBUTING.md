# Contributing to Mikan

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our rigging framework! 🎉

This project was originally developed as an internal production tool at TeamTO Studio. We're now releasing it as open source to share it with the wider community — while maintaining a high level of stability and consistency with how we use it in production.


## 🙋‍♀️ Before You Start

Before contributing, please read through the following sections to understand how we work, what kind of contributions are (or aren’t) welcome at this stage, and how we collaborate with the community.


## 🔍 Project Status

- This framework is **actively used in production**, but this is still an early public release.
- **We currently do not have automated tests** in place.
- The core system architecture is relatively complex and requires some experience to modify safely.


## ✅ What Kind of Contributions Are Welcome?

### ✔️ Actively Welcome:
- **Bug fixes**: any pull request that improves stability is appreciated.
- **Documentation improvements**: clarity, additions, usage examples — all contributions here are valuable.
- **Peripheral tools**: utilities, scripts, or extensions that work alongside the core system.

### ⚠️ With Caution:
- **Core system improvements**: we’re open to suggestions, but these changes will be reviewed carefully. Please open an issue to discuss before submitting a PR.
- **New features**: same as above — let’s talk about it first.

### ❌ Currently Not Accepted:
- Major refactors or full rewrites of the core system without prior discussion.
- Adding heavy third-party dependencies without a strong justification.


## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new branch from `main`.
3. Make your changes with clear commit messages.
4. Open a **pull request**, explaining what you did and why.
5. Be ready to collaborate: we might ask for adjustments before merging.


## 🤝 Communication & Review Process

- Every PR will be reviewed carefully, especially those that touch core logic.
- Maintainers reserve the right to reject contributions that may compromise the project’s reliability or coherence.
- For anything significant, **open an issue first** to avoid unnecessary work on both sides.


## 💬 Questions or Suggestions?
